    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate student of Computer Science at University of Calgary, formerly a Computer Science undergraduate at University of California Santa Cruz. My current Masterʼs program involves reverse engineering of old video games that were hand-written in assembly and analyzing the human practices and patterns present in that era of games programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the summer of 2025, I interned at <Ae href="https://reken.ai/" hreflang="en">Reken</Ae> as a software developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Many of my interests involve the interaction between “levels of computation”, i.e. compilers, decompilers, reverse engineering tools, and hardware-software interactions. I like to understand the ways we translate between higher- and lower-level models, and I find it fun to use that understanding to create transformative works like modding APIs. I think itʼs important to understand these tools to gain more insight on the different ways programs can be modeled.
    </p>
    <h3>Programming Languages/Compilers</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently working on designing a compiler for an OCaml-like language that outputs <Ae href="https://fallingcolors.github.io/HexMod/" hreflang="en">Hexcasting</Ae> patterns. The unique challenges in this space are that Hexcasting operations are performed entirely on the stack, as well as that Hexcasting is a <Ae href="https://www.concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language" hreflang="en">concatenative language</Ae>, meaning recursive bindings and operations become quite complex tasks. At the moment I have yet to write formal documentation on how the language behaves, however I have made available <Ae href="https://gist.github.com/s5bug/5f453c9c159fb77bad9dff1a8954fb3b" hreflang="en">notes</Ae> that chronologically document my thinking process.
    </p>
    <h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      Iʼve been reverse engineering and modding games (among other software) for a while. Most recently, Iʼve been working on reverse engineering the scripts used in <Ae href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Oasis" hreflang="en"><cite>Ever Oasis</cite></Ae>, and then I plan to move onto reverse engineering the game engine. <cite>Ever Oasis</cite> uses <Ae href="http://squirrel-lang.org/" hreflang="en">Squirrel</Ae> scripts internally: this is the same language Valve calls VScript, but while Valve stores all scripts in plaintext format, <cite>Ever Oasis</cite> ships blobs of Squirrel bytecode. I couldnʼt find any existing tools to aid in the reverse engineering process of Squirrel bytecode, so I made my own tool <Ae href="https://s5bug.github.io/squirrel-explorer/" hreflang="en">squirrel-explorer</Ae> that uses a mix of WebAssembly and <Ae href="https://www.scala-js.org/" hreflang="en">Scala.js</Ae> to run the Squirrel compiler on the userʼs code, disassemble an uploaded file, and compare the assembly for the user to try and match.
    </p>
    <h3>Hardware-Software Interactions</h3>
    <p>
      For a long time, I have had an interest in clockless computing, where rather than waiting for a clock signal to proceed to the next pipeline stage, CPUs process data and events as they become available. There are already companies exploring this type of design, such as <Ae href="http://www.greenarraychips.com/" hreflang="en">GreenArrays</Ae>, who are developing clockless circuits built to be energy-efficient. One of my longstanding interests is functional and streaming paradigms such as those featured in <Ae href="https://fs2.io/" hreflang="en">fs2</Ae> and <Ae href="https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/" hreflang="en">cats-effect</Ae>, and I would like to see if taking inspiration from these paradigms could lead to a more unified approach to reactive computing.
    </p>

    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I currently mainly program in <Ae href="https://scala-lang.org/" hreflang="en">Scala</Ae>, and am very proficient in Java. Other languages I am able to program easily in include C, C++, C#, Rust, and Kotlin. I have experience writing TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, F#, <Ae href="https://crystal-lang.org/" hreflang="en">Crystal</Ae>, Lua, and Haskell. My GitHub username is currently <Ae href="https://github.com/s5bug" hreflang="en">s5bug</Ae>.
    </p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      My all-time top 5 favorite games:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><cite>Ever Oasis</cite></li>
      <li><cite>Marble Saga: Kororinpa</cite></li>
      <li><cite><Ae href="https://www.minodevgames.com/rabbit-steel" hreflang="en">Rabbit &amp; Steel</Ae></cite></li>
      <li><cite>Celeste</cite></li>
      <li><cite>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</cite></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      One of my favorite ways to game is to be faced with the same difficult challenge for hours on end and gradually chip away at it. I can back this up with my hundreds of hours in <cite>Geometry Dash</cite> and hundreds more in <cite>Celeste</cite>. <cite>Ever Oasis</cite> also has a grind-heavy postgame, and Iʼm still working towards 100% completion on my main savefile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to play a lot of <cite>Final Fantasy XIV</cite>: in only 2 months it became my most-played game, and itʼs a game I now have spent over 2,000 hours in. I mainly played Fisher, Monk, and Black Mage, and enjoyed blind and world progression. When Monk and Black Mage were simplified in Dawntrail, I dropped them to play Pictomancer, but the continued simplification of skill rotations has taken all of the enjoyment out of the game for me. Instead, I recreated 4.3ʼs “Tornado Kick Monk” entirely in a Minecraft mod (<Ae href="https://github.com/s5bug/alymod" hreflang="en">alymod</Ae>), which is pretty enjoyable.
