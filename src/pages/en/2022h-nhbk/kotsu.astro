<Layout title="Japanese Culture 2022 Spring: Getting Around" description="Getting around in the cities of Furano, Yokohama, and Fukuoka.">
  <h1>Getting Around</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Furano</h2>

    <p>
      The sights around Furano are not easily reachable via public transportation.<Cite id="japan-guide-furano-kotsu"/> One can get around on rental bicycles. If arriving via air, a bicycle can be rented over multiple days from Fuji Shoukai in Asahikawa.<Cite id="fuji-shoukai"/> If you arrive by train in Furano, it's possible to rent an electric bike from the Furano Nature Club, but it seems one must rent on a day-by-day basis.<Cite id="furano-nature-club" /> However, it may be best to just bring one's own bike and pay the fees to transport it via the train.<Cite id="japan-guide-jitensha"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not want to bike, then the sightseeing buses are an option. However, the buses mainly only run during summer months, and are not a serious exploration option.

    <h2>Yokohama</h2>

    <p>
      Yokohama has a very complete transit system. While central Yokohama can easily be explored on foot, there are two buses that loop around central Yokohama: the Bayside Blue Bus with an endpoint at Yokohama Station, and the Akaikutsu Bus with an endpoint at Sakuragicho Station.<Cite id="japan-guide-yokohama-kotsu"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you fancy sightseeing, then you have the option of a voyage along Yokohama's bay area via the Sea Bass (wordplay on "Sea Bus"<Cite id="yokohama-cruising-seabass"/>). It has a stop at each peninsula, as well as one near Yokohama Station.<Cite id="yokohama-visitors-guide-seabass"/>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Fukuoka</h2>

    <p>
      Fukuoka has a subway that connects most major locations, including Hakata Station, the city's main station, and Fukuoka Airport.<Cite id="japan-guide-fukuoka-kotsu"/> A cheaper option will be the Nishitetsu bus lines, with a route map<Cite id="nishitetsu-bus-route-map"/> so comprehensive that many computers will struggle to render it.
