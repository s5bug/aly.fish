        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an undergraduate student of Computer Science, currently at the University of California Santa Cruz.
        </p>

        <h3>Software/PLT</h3>
        <p>
            One of my longstanding interests is functional and streaming paradigms such as those featured in
            <a rel="external" href="https://fs2.io/">fs2</a> and
            <a rel="external" href="https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/">cats-effect</a>. One of the concepts I would
            like to more deeply investigate at some point is the interactions between userspace applications employing
            cooperative multithreading and operating system kernels using preemptive scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working on designing a compiler for an OCaml-like language that outputs
            <a rel="external" href="https://fallingcolors.github.io/HexMod/">Hexcasting</a> patterns. The unique
            challenges in this space are that Hexcasting operations are performed entirely on the stack, as well as that
            Hexcasting is a
            <a rel="external" href="https://www.concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language">concatenative language</a>,
            meaning recursive bindings and operations become quite complex tasks. At the moment I have yet to write
            formal documentation on how the language behaves, however I have made available
            <a rel="external" href="https://gist.github.com/s5bug/5f453c9c159fb77bad9dff1a8954fb3b">notes</a> that
            chronologically document my thinking process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another one of my longstanding projects that I would like to complete is a compiler into
            <a rel="external" href="https://www.fancade.com/">Fancade</a> levels. It's on the back-burner for now, as
            compiling into Fancade's execution flow is quite a complex task.
        </p>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>
            For a long time, I have had an interest in clockless computing, where rather than waiting for a clock signal
            to proceed to the next pipeline stage, CPUs process data and events as they become available. There are
            already companies exploring this type of design, such as
            <a rel="external" href="http://www.greenarraychips.com/">GreenArrays</a>, who are developing clockless
            circuits built to be energy-efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding energy-efficiency, another inspiration of mine is the
            <a rel="external" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">Low-tech Magazine</a>, a blog entirely
            powered by solar. At some point, I would like to try hosting this site (or a subsection of it) on my own
            renewable energy.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I currently mainly program in <a rel="external" href="https://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, and am very
            proficient in Java. Other languages I am able to program easily in include C, C++, C#, Rust, and Kotlin. I
            have experience writing TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, F#,
            <a rel="external" href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, Lua, and Haskell. My GitHub lies at
            <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/s5bug">s5bug</a>, but many of my projects remain unpublished.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I've been playing music since 2008 when I started piano. Since 2013 I have been practicing the flute, and
            for the years 2019 and 2020, I was the first-chair flautist in Marching Band. Since, my focus has mainly
            shifted to EWI. One of my current hobbies is transcribing my favorite songs, and to aid me with the process
            I would like to learn drum-set and relearn piano.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
            One of my favorite ways to game is to be faced with the same difficult challenge for hours on end and
            gradually chip away at it. I can back this up with my hundreds of hours in Geometry Dash and hundreds more
            in Celeste. Other  games among my favorites are The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Marble Saga:
            Kororinpa, Hollow Knight, and Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising.
        </p>
        <p>
            Final Fantasy XIV, which in only 2 months became my most-played game, is a game I now have spent over 2,000
            hours in (6 times my second-most played game). You can see my current status and achievements on
            <a rel="external" href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/43918131/">my Lodestone page</a>.
            I mainly play Fisher, Monk, and Black Mage. I very much enjoy blind/world progression, and hope some day I
            can find a group with my same mindset.

        <p>
            When I need to make a portfolio for school, I make webpages here. To keep time in lexicographical order, I
            use a numbering system that places the autumn of one year into the next year.
