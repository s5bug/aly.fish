        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer from California in the United States.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I'm most interested in software and hardware development based around the concept of functional reactive
            streams. At some point, I would like to develop hardware and a corresponding operating system that lends
            itself easily to <a href="https://fs2.io/">fs2</a>- and
            <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/">cats-effect</a>-like programming. I believe that those
            frameworks lend themselves to easier understanding of programs as well as higher maintainability, but most
            important to me is the environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm quite interested in energy-efficient computing, having my eyes on companies like <a>GreenArrays</a>, who
            are developing clockless circuits built to be energy-efficient, and technology like the
            <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">Low-tech Magazine</a>, a blog entirely powered by
            solar. In conjunction with low-power computing is making the internet more accessible and less costly. One
            of the reasons this website is so bare-bones is because I want it to be navigable in low-cost browsers such
            as Lynx and EWW.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for programming accomplishments, and not aspirations, I currently mainly program in
            <a href="https://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, and am very proficient in Java. Other languages I am able to
            program easily in include C, C++, F#, Kotlin, and <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. I have experience
            writing Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, and Haskell,
            but I would not consider myself skilled enough to write programs easily in them. My GitHub URL at the moment
            is <a href="https://github.com/s5bug">s5bug</a>, but this is likely to change. Unfortunately, my project
            descriptions are only available in English.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, I would like to be able to be comfortable making games in
            <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, as well as
            <a href="https://www.petc4.smilebasic.com/?lang=en">SmileBASIC 4</a>. I have been wanting to make something
            substantial in SmileBASIC 4 for a long time, but haven't learned how to use it correctly yet.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            The two most-played musical instruments in my possession are my flute (a Yamaha YFL-200ADII) and my AKAI EWI
            Solo. I very much like playing jazz as well as video game music. At some point, I'd like to learn how to use
            a <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> so that I can make full pieces playing on my own
            instruments. Other instruments I have access to include an acoustic guitar (unknown model) and a clarinet
            (unknown model).
        </p>

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, I have become more interested in category and type theory. The main reason for my interest in
            these types of math is the ways in which they can be applied to the aspects of software and hardware
            development I care about. Currently, I'm interested in solidifying my understanding of category theory by
            writing compilers from complex languages into toy languages like
            <a href="https://www.fancade.com/">Fancade</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
            Playing video games is my go-to past-time. My favorite games so far are, in no particular order, Celeste,
            Marble Saga: Kororinpa, Mario Kart Wii, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I've completed numerous
            Ocarina of Time randomizers. I very much enjoy Ocarina of Time Multiworld randomizers, as they allow me to
            spend time having fun with my friends. I don't have to focus on the game at all times, but it is still an
            incredibly enjoyable mental challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm in the process of playing through a Minecraft 1.18 world with my friends, as well as
            progressing through my first playthrough of Hollow Knight.
