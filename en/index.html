        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            While my main interests lie in more theoretical Computer Science, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's
            degree in Game Design.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I'm most interested in software and hardware development based around the concept of functional reactive
            streams. At some point, I would like to develop hardware and a corresponding operating system that lends
            itself easily to <a href="https://fs2.io/">fs2</a>- and
            <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/">cats-effect</a>-like programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm quite interested in energy-efficient computing, having my eyes on companies like
            <a href="http://www.greenarraychips.com/">GreenArrays</a>, who are developing clockless circuits built to be
            energy-efficient, and technology like the
            <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">Low-tech Magazine</a>, a blog entirely powered by
            solar.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently mainly program in <a href="https://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, and am very proficient in Java.
            Other languages I am able to  program easily in include C, C++, F#, C#, and Kotlin. I have experience
            writing Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, Lua, and
            Haskell, but I would not consider myself skilled enough to write programs easily in them. My GitHub lies at
            <a href="https://github.com/s5bug">s5bug</a>, but many of my projects are not published.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to be able to be comfortable making games in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, as
            well as <a href="https://www.petc4.smilebasic.com/?lang=en">SmileBASIC 4</a>. I have been wanting to make
            something substantial in SmileBASIC 4 for a long time, but haven't learned how to use it correctly yet.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I've been playing music since 2008 when I started piano. The skills of piano are now lost to me (although
            I plan to make an effort to reclaim them), but since 2013 I have been practicing the flute. In the 2019-2020
            school year, I was the first-chair flautist in Marching Band.
        </p>

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
            A lot of my side projects tend to dip heavily into mathematics. Many of my recent endeavours have been
            related to concepts developed in Category Theory and Type Theory. For a long time I have been trying to
            write a compiler that takes text-based programs and outputs <a href="https://www.fancade.com/">Fancade</a>
            programs, and I've been able to apply learned CT/TT concepts to that development.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
            Trying the same thing for hours on end is a core part of my character. My personality, and especially my
            gaming habits, have been shaped by my hundreds of hours in Geometry Dash and hundreds more in Celeste. Other
            games among my favorites are The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Marble Saga: Kororinpa, and Hollow
            Knight.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current time-sink is Final Fantasy XIV, which in only 2 months became my most-played game (and then
            doubled that time). You can see my current status and achievements on
            <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/43918131/">my Lodestone page</a>. I want to
            start exploring the more difficult content available in XIV, but it's hard to find people who
            share my Geometry Dash/Celeste mindset; most will ask players to watch guides on the content beforehand, and
            even more do not want to play any of the older content.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it has become one of my (if not my most) favorite games, I want to eventually write a whole standalone
            page about my XIV thoughts and experiences.

        <h2>School Projects</h2>
        <p>
            When I need to make a portfolio for school, I make webpages here. To keep time in lexicographical order, I
            use a numbering system that places the autumn of one year into the next year.
