    <h1>Points of Interest</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Fukuoka</h2>

        <p>
            One of Fukuoka's most famous attractions are the nightly food stands called <i>Yatai</i>. The <i>Yatai</i>
            offer many different types of Japanese foods, including ramen, oden, gyōza, yakitori, and tempura. They're
            scattered throughout downtown Fukuoka. A map and list of food stands is available from YOKANAVI, a Fukuoka
            tourism website.<sup><a href="#cite-yokanavi-yatai">1</a></sup>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            Fukuoka also lays claim to the oldest Zen Buddhist temple in
            Japan.<sup><a href="#cite-shofukuji-history">2</a></sup> While you're not allowed to step foot inside the
            buildings of Shōfukuji Temple, you can still take in the scenic temple
            grounds.<sup><a href="#cite-japan-guide-shofukuji">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            The third main point of interest in Fukuoka would be the Canal City shopping complex. Canal City Hakata
            provides "about 250 shops, cafes and restaurants, a theater, game center, cinemas, two hotels and a canal
            running through the complex".<sup><a href="#cite-japan-guide-canal-city-hakata">4</a></sup> If you're
            feeling a bit homesick, Canal City has plenty of shops for brands that you would find in the US. However,
            Canal City also boasts a large amount of Japanese stores, including its 5th "Ramen Stadium" floor which is
            entirely dedicated to different kinds of ramen.<sup><a href="#cite-canal-city-floor-map">5</a></sup>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            And finally, another historical location to visit in Fukuoka would be the ruins of its once-famous castle.
            The best time to visit is near the beginning of April, as the park around the castle is a prime spot for
            cherry-blossom viewing.
        </p>

        <h2>Uchiko</h2>

        <p>
            Uchiko is quite like a time capsule for Japan: it is known for its preservation and restoration projects.
            The two main attractions here, the Yōkaichi Old Town and the Kamihaga Residence, are discussed in
            <a href="./bunkateki-haikei.html">Cultural Backgrounds</a>. The Kamihaga Residence is available to tour with
            a tour guide, which is recommended.<sup><a href="#cite-we-love-uchiko-kamihaga">6</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Uchiko History Museum, offering more in-depth explorations into the lives of Uchiko residents of the
            19th and 20th centuries, lies just outside Yōkaichi Old Town. Most of the written material is in Japanese,
            and tour guides do not seem to be available.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <figcaption>[Here will be an image of the inside of the Uchiko History Museum, to emphasize that all inside text is in Japanese.]</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Every year during the 4th Sunday of April, Uchiko holds its Kawanobori River Festival, in which residents
            recreate the experience of the rafting once used for the transport of
            logs.<sup><a href="#cite-we-love-uchiko-kawanoborikawamatsuri">7</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h2>Kurobe Gorge</h2>

        <p>
            As the Kurobe Gorge Railway is mainly a tourist attraction nowadays, there's plenty of stops and things to
            see. At the first station, Unazuki Station, which you will depart from on the railway, there's many things
            you can explore beforehand. Of historical interest may be the Kurobe River Electric Memorial Hall, detailing
            the importance of the Kurobe Dam in Japan's industrialization efforts. Additionally, the Yamabiko Walkway
            offers a nice view of the Shin Yamabiko Bridge.
        </p>

            <img width="2048" height="1536" src="../../2022h-nhbk/shin-yamabiko-bridge.jpg"

        </figure>

        <p>
            The second station, Kuronagi Station features a bridge, Atobiki Bridge, and an onsen, Kuronagi Onsen. The
            third station, Kanetsuri Station, is connected to an observation deck that allows one to observe the Mannen
            Yuki, or Ten Thousand Year Snow.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final station of the Kurobe Gorge Railway, Keyakidara Station, features a large pedestrian bridge,
            Okukane Bridge, leading to Babadani Onsen and Meiken Onsen, which are both also ryokan (Japanese-style
            inns).
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Yokohama</h2>

        <p>
            Yokohama is one of the most populated cities in Japan, second to Tokyo. As such, there's plenty to do.
            Yokohama is equipped with the largest of Japan's three Chinatowns, popular for its unique mixing of Chinese
            dishes into a Japanese style.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're looking for a more low-energy experience, Sankeien Garden is a Japanese-style garden featuring
            traditional Japanese buildings. Of course, it's a garden, so there's not much to "do": you are meant to
            relax, explore, and take in the scenery.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="900" height="600" src="../../2022h-nhbk/rindoan-tea-house.jpg"
                 alt="A Japanese tea house partially obscured by trees. The stones in front of the house are visibly wet from rain.">

        </figure>

        <p>
            Yokohama is also home to Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, an amusement park with a few aquariums. Entrance into the
            park itself is free, as it is lined with various shops and restaurants, but the areas with rides or
            aquariums have entrance fees.
        </p>

        <p>
            The set of three aquariums, Aqua Resorts, consists of the Aqua Museum, Dolphin Fantasy, and the Fureai
            Lagoon. In the Fureai Lagoon, one is allowed to touch some of the animals, and for an extra fee, can sign
            up for a guided tour where even more interaction, such as feeding, is allowed.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Furano</h2>

        <p>
            Furano's most famous attraction is its flower fields. One of the most popular places to get a good look at
            flower fields would be Farm Tomita. Most of the flowers enter full-bloom around June and July, but many
            fields will be flowering by May.<sup><a href="#cite-farm-tomita-flower-guide">8</a></sup>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width="2048" height="1536" src="../../2022h-nhbk/hokkaido-flower-field.jpg"
                 alt="A flower field in Hokkaido. Closest to the photographer are yellow flowers with long petals, and behind those are purple flowers with short petals. Far away are white, pink, and red flowers.">

        </figure>

        <p>
            Another one of Furano's attractions is its cheese factory. The factory, which also sells ice milk
            ("ice milk" and "ice cream" are <em>by law</em> different in Japan due to dairy
            content<sup><a href="#cite-jfftc-icecream">9</a></sup>) and bread, offers workshops for making various dairy
            products. You should call in beforehand to reserve, and make sure that you reserve on a day when enough
            people will be attending. Furano Cheese Factory offers menus in both Japanese and English on which prices
            and requirements are listed.<sup><a href="#cite-furano-cheese-factory-taiken">10</a></sup>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            Finally, if you're willing to go out of your way, a good sight-seeing location would be the Blue Pond about
            a 2 hour bike-ride from Farm Tomita. You are not allowed to enter the pond, much less drink the pond water,
            but the intent is for it to be a good resting or tourism
            spot.<sup><a href="#cite-biei-sightseeing-blue-pond">11</a></sup>
        </p>
