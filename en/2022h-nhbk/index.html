        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            In this course, we as students are asked to study Japanese culture and history, and tie that material into
            a trip around Japan, a samurai-related movie, and a piece of Japanese literature (written from a Japanese
            perspective).

        <h2>Trip Around Japan</h2>

        <p>
            For my 5 locations, I picked four towns/cities, and one tourist location. In Hokkaido, I chose the town of
            Furano. In Honshu, I chose the city of Yokohama, and the tourist location of the Kurobe Gorge. In Shikoku,
            I chose the town of Uchiko. In Kyushu, I chose the city of Fukuoka.
        </p>

        <p>
            The best way to travel between these areas would be to start at the south during late spring, and start
            heading north, to get the best weather and opportunities for all activities.

        <p>
            In each location, Google Maps will be sufficient to just get around, but if you want to be efficient with
            time, or want to be able to go sightseeing, each area has its transportation quirks you'll need to know.

        </p>

        <p>
            Each location is very unique in what it offers, giving you a nicely varied experience of Japan.

        <p>
            Each of these locations plays an important part in Japanese history, whether it be past or current.

        <h2>Samurai: Then vs. Now</h2>

        <p>
            For the course's samurai movie, I was recommended by a friend to watch <cite>A Boy and His Samurai</cite>,
            a comedy about a samurai who travels forward in time from 1826 in the Edo period to 2006 in modern Japan.

        <h2>Works of Literature</h2>

        <p>
            I was recommended by another friend to consider one of Akira Kurosawa's movies to analyze as a Japanese
            perspective on Japanese culture. I watched both <cite>Dreams</cite> and <cite>Ikiru</cite>. They are very
            different works in terms of their style and their messages, so I feel it important to talk about both.

        <h2>What's Happening</h2>

        <p>
            Throughout the course, we were asked to find news articles that we found interesting, surprising, or useful
            to discuss in some other way. Most recently I chose to dig into an article that summarized the Reporters
            Without Borders report on Japan, noting its decrease on the press freedom index.
