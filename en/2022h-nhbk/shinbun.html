        <p>
            This article by Japan Times briefly touches on recent rating changes of prominent countries with regard to
            how restricted the press is, according to the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) organization. The first
            interesting detail is Japan's placement: Japan ranks significantly lower (about 10%) compared to its
            neighbors Australia and South Korea. Additionally, Japan's ranking is lowered from 2021, suggesting a
            decrease in journalistic integrity. Japan Times cites the RSF as attributing the decrease in freedom to the
            increased social influence of industrial groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over recent years, Japan has been losing points due to political pressures. In 2015 and 2016, certain
            let-gos implied that Japanese news sources would strongly rather not face the consequences for criticizing
            the government.<sup><a href="#cite-foreign-policy-shinzo-abe-media">1</a></sup> Because newscasters and
            writers strongly feel obligated to please their superiors, and government officials have close ties with
            media executives, material contradictory to the government's own messaging is not produced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Digging into the RSF report itself, we can find that this has been a long-standing issue. There are
            restrictions on which agencies and reporters can attend government events or speak with government
            officials. Combined with the nationalist climate of the government, news agencies must avoid showing Japan
            or the administration in a bad light, or else they may face hostility from politicians and nationalist
            groups as well as risk being disallowed from first-hand reporting of government
            activities.<sup><a href="#cite-rsf-japan">2</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            While not as harmful as the news climate leading up to World War II, there are visible signs of nationalism
            in the press. Reporters who express criticism of the government are let go, agencies who express criticism
            of the government are not allowed to attend government events, and journalists who express criticism of the
            government can face harassment from nationalist groups.
