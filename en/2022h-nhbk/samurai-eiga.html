    <h1>Samurai Movie Report</h1>

    <section>
        <h2><cite>A Boy and His Samurai</cite></h2>

        <p>
            <cite>A Boy and His Samurai</cite> features a samurai sent forward in time from 1826 to 2006. He is
            accustomed to the Edo period, and the movie heavily focuses on the differences in customs, beliefs, and
            social power between the Edo period and modern Japan.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are first introduced to a single mother, Hiroko Yusa, and her young son, Tomoya Yusa. It's clear that
            Hiroko has trouble balancing her job with taking care of Tomoya: at work, she is regarded poorly by her
            superiors due to her occasional lateness and instant clock-outs.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we are introduced to our samurai character, Kijima Yasube, he at first is aggressively defensive: when
            scared by Tomoya during hide-and-seek, he whips out his katana as if he is being attacked. When the home
            phone rings, he attempts to find an intruder, before being explained via speaker that he can answer via the
            handset. However, because of Hiroko's kindness, Kijima respects and cares for the Yusa household. Kijima is
            able to take care of Tomoya, as well as do the housework and the cooking, allowing Hiroko to arrive to work
            on time and stay as late as her coworkers.
        </p>

        <p>
            We see life in Edo in stark contrast to life in modern Tokyo through Kijima. He is surprised by Hiroko and
            Tomoya having surnames, as that is something he associates with being a samurai. He goes through very formal
            and demonstrative motions to accept gifts, to emphasize himself as of a lower status. He uses the older
            samurai pronoun, <i>sessha</i>, instead of one of the more modern pronouns (the most common in modern times
            being <i>watashi</i>, <i>watakushi</i>, <i>boku</i>, and <i>ore</i>). Instead of the formal <i>desu</i>,
            informal <i>da</i>, or newspaper-y <i>dearu</i>, Kijima uses the copula <i>degozaru</i>, which is fancy to
            the point of sounding strange (unless you're customer service, and say <i>degozaimasu</i> to customers).
            Additionally, a scene of Kijima writing in a journal is shown. As Kijima is from a time before the Meiji
            restoration, itself before the writing reform of 1900, he is most likely writing in an older style of
            Japanese.
        </p>

        <p>
            All in all, I highly recommend watching <cite>A Boy and His Samurai</cite>. Even if you're not familiar with
            the Japanese language, the movie is still hilarious, as well as enticing, from the twists and turns of the
            plot.
